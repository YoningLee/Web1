HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings,
    links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn't have the
    ability to create dynamic functionality.
